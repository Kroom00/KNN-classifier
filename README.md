## k-Nearest Neighbors Classification

### Dataset Overview:
- The Caravan dataset is loaded and preprocessed, converting non-numeric values to numeric ones.

### Data Splitting:
- A strategic split is executed, allocating 1000 observations to the test set and the remainder to the training set.

### Model Fitting:
- The kNN model is fitted on the training data, specifically using k = 3.

### Model Testing:
- Model performance is assessed using the test set.
- A confusion matrix is presented for a comprehensive visualization of classification outcomes.

### Tuning Parameter:
- The kNN classifier is applied for values of k in the range {1, 2, ..., 5}.
- Classifier accuracy for each k is reported, and the optimal k value is identified.
